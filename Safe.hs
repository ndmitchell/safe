A module wrapping @Prelude@/@Data.List@ functions that can throw exceptions, such as @head@ and @!!@.
Each unsafe function has up to five variants, e.g. with @tail@:

* @'tail' :: [a] -> [a]@, raises an error on @tail []@, as provided by 'Prelude'.

* @'tailErr' :: [a] -> [a]@, alias for @tail@ that doesn't trigger an @x-partial@ warning and does raise errors.

* @'tailMay' :: [a] -> /Maybe/ [a]@, turns errors into @Nothing@.

* @'tailDef' :: /[a]/ -> [a] -> [a]@, takes a default to return on errors.

* @'tailNote' :: 'Partial' => /String/ -> [a] -> [a]@, takes an extra argument which supplements the error message.

* @'tailSafe' :: [a] -> [a]@, returns some sensible default if possible, @[]@ in the case of @tail@.

All functions marked with the @'Partial'@ constraint are not total, and will produce stack traces on error, on GHC
versions which support them (see "GHC.Stack").

This module also introduces some new functions, documented at the top of the module.
