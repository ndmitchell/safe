{- |
A library for safe functions, based on standard functions that may crash.

In general, each unsafe function has up to 4 forms.
Since 'tail' has all the possible forms, it is fully documented.
The others all follow the same pattern.


* @Note@, takes an extra argument which supplements the error message, 'tailNote'

* @Def@, take an extra argument to give when a crash would otherwise happen, 'tailDef'

* @May@, wraps the result in a Maybe, 'tailMay'

* @Safe@, returns a default type if possible, 'tailSafe'

This library also introduces three brand new functions:

* 'at' - synonym for @(!!)@

* 'lookupJust' - defined as @lookupJust k = fromJust . lookup k@

* 'findJust' - defined as @findJust f = fromJust . find f@

* 'abort' - same as @error@, but different intended meaning
